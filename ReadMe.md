The authors of:

- CLA SSE: Crah Log Analyzer SSE - Skyrim - Sephrajin
Have combined their power and skills to give you the best experience to have when crash landing on your desktop.

### Requirements
In order to get a crash log we can work on, these files / mods are required:
- [SFSE]()
- [Crashlog Writer]()

---

### Installation
As usual, extract the "zipfile" to either:
- Logdir, which usualy is: %userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Starfield\SFSE
- Toolldir, usualy something like: E:\Vortex\-Tools\CRASH_VERSION

---

### Guarantee or Warranty
Allthough written with best intention to help and assist to solve issues, we both deny any accountablity or responsibility for any possible harm that might happen due to executing CRASH on your computer.

This is due to the nature of unforseeable bugs, system settings, system conditions, malformed crashlog files and whatnot...

- NONE
    - Not Available
    - As in, niente, nada, not available, nix, rien!

### Bugs / Reporting issues
Eventhough the CRASH has been tested before each release on our very own systems to work properly, this does not mean that the tool is perfect.

To report bugs, please use either:
- [NexusMods - Bugs]()
- [GitHub - Issues]()
