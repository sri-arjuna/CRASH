![Requirements](docs/img/32_Requirements.png)

In order to get a crash log we can work on, these files / mods are required:
* Nexus (exe ; recommended):
    * [SFSE](https://github.com/ianpatt/sfse)
    * [Crashlog Writer]()
* Github (script ; for nerds and developers):
    * Same as the 'Nexus' variant, AND:
    * [Python 3.11 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * [AspireTUI](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/ASPIRE)
        * Please make sure to create a relative ``mklink`` to it within the directory you want to execute CRASH.py from.
        * From an administrator console terminal, enter something like: ``mklink ../ASPIRE/aspire AspireTUI`` when you are at the location of CRASH.py

Allthough written with best intention to help and assist to solve issues, we both deny any accountablity or responsibility for any possible harm that might happen due to executing CRASH on your computer.

This is due to the nature of unforseeable bugs, system settings, system conditions, malformed crashlog files and whatnot...
