![Guarantee or Warranty](docs/img/32_No_Warranty.png)

Allthough written with best intention to help and assist to solve issues, we both deny any accountablity or responsibility for any possible harm that might happen due to executing CRASH on your computer.

This is due to the nature of unforseeable bugs, system settings, system conditions, malformed crashlog files and whatnot...

- NONE
    - Not Available
    - As in, niente, nada, not available, nix, rien!

![Bug Reports](docs/img/32_Bug_Reports.png)

Eventhough the CRASH has been tested before each release on our very own systems to work properly, this does not mean that the tool is perfect.

To report bugs, please use either:
